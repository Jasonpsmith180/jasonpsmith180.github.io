## About the project
Creating an online portfolio of the work I have done will let potential employers gauge my experience and see if I am a potential candidate for a position. I used a few new techniques to build this portfolio including: flexbox and media queries. I also learned some new dynamic text sizing options like vw (viewport width) and rem (relative to root element) instead of px for font sizing which were really cool!

The portfolio has been published at the following URL:
